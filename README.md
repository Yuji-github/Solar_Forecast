### 1.Purposes
Our climate is changing every single day because we consume more fuel since we have discovered the power of fuel. We believe that we should shift to using more recyclable energy sources like solar. However, generating power by solar is unstable because of the weather conditions. To solve the problem, we need to predict the generation of power, and we can store the power in the battery effectively. This project demonstrates how to predict the generation of power for 7 days by using machine learning.
